*Date*: 2025-08-06 06:17 UTC

*Engine*: `autonomous_evolution_engine.py`

## Benchmark

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Baseline Runtime | **33.85 ms** |
| Improved Runtime | **0.09 ms** |
| Relative Improvement | **99.7 % faster** |

The engine autonomously evolved a naive recursive `fib` implementation into an optimised version (memoised/iterative), achieving a **>350× speed-up** while maintaining correctness – all using pure-Python transformations and zero external dependencies.

The best evolved code was saved to `best_evolved_code.py` for inspection.
