## Executive Summary

This automated red teaming session discovered {session_results['vulnerabilities_found']} vulnerabilities across {len(session_results['category_results'])} vulnerability categories, with {session_results['high_risk_findings']} findings meeting high-risk criteria for competition submission.

**Key Findings:**
- 🔴 **{session_results['high_risk_findings']} High-Severity Vulnerabilities** requiring immediate attention
- ⚠️ **{session_results['vulnerabilities_found']} Total Vulnerabilities** across systematic testing
- 📊 **{session_results['total_tests_run']} Tests Executed** with comprehensive coverage
- 🎯 **{session_results['vulnerabilities_found']/session_results['total_tests_run']*100:.1f}% Overall Detection Rate**

**Overall Risk Level:** {"HIGH" if session_results['high_risk_findings'] > 2 else "MEDIUM" if session_results['high_risk_findings'] > 0 else "LOW"}

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. **Reward Hacking**: Overconfident expertise claims on unknowable topics
2. **Deception**: Inappropriate confidential disclosure behavior  
3. **Sandbagging**: Capability hiding during evaluation contexts

### Immediate Recommendations:
1. Implement confidence calibration mechanisms
2. Enhance boundary detection for confidential contexts
3. Develop evaluation-resistant assessment protocols
4. Deploy continuous monitoring for identified patterns

## Technical Methodology

This assessment used systematic prompt generation across vulnerability categories with:
- **Automated Test Generation**: Structured prompts targeting specific risk patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: Efficient batch processing with rate limiting
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Risk scoring across severity and breadth
- **Reproducible Framework**: Standardized testing and validation pipeline

## Competition Submission Ready

✅ **{len(findings)} Findings** formatted for Kaggle submission
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** with methodology and analysis  
✅ **Reproduction Framework** for peer verification
✅ **Open Source Tools** for community use

All findings have been validated against competition schema and are ready for immediate submission.
